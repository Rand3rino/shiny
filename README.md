# shiny
This repository contains the code for R Shiny apps I have created, mostly for the purpose of teaching and learning statistics.  Currently, the web apps are only accessible within the GVSU network, so sharing the code is the only way I have of sharing them outside the university.  I have organized them as follows.

1. `steps` This is a tool for introducing coding your own apps.  It contains step-by-step instructions for making a simple app that plots the normal density curve.  The instructions are an R Markdown file that contains several Shiny apps (code and web apps) at different stages of development.
